            <h2>Life History</h2>
            <p>Most recently I have been a <strong>Teaching Assistant at Boise Code Works</strong> after graduating from the full-stack development class there. 
During that time I learned a variety of languages and platforms including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular. We were also introduced to Node, .NET and C#. <br>
My “capstone project” for this class was the conception, development and design of a product I named “Musical-Keymaster.” My team of two other students and myself produced this program in just over a month. The app takes in a pasted chord sheet and transposes the chord references to whatever key the end user desires. There is also a private storage area for users to keep their stash of songs.
</p>
<p>Prior to that, I worked for the <strong>Divine Lotus Tea Company</strong> (aka The Shangri La Tea Room & Restaurant) based in Boise. <br>
While there I learned to manage my time efficiently. I also used my skills in how to be productive in a loosely structured, low supervision environment. <br>
In order to use my time there most efficiently, I developed and organized the herb and tea inventory which optimized my (and other employees) ability to find stocked items. In conjunction with this, I created an inventory checklist which was used for the reorder process when items periodically went out of stock. I also built a spreadsheet to track gross income from retail tea sales and graph them quarterly.
</p>
<p>Prior to my time at Divine Lotus, I was <strong>Self-Employed</strong> at a variety of jobs including but not limited to: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Massage Therapy</li>
                <li>Light Handyman Services</li>
                <li>Professional Musican</li>
                <li>Typesetting/Graphic Design</li>
            </ul>
 </p>
