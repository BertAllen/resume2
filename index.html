                    <h2>Work/Education History</h2>
                    <p>Most recently I have been a <strong>Teaching Assistant at Boise Code Works</strong> after graduating
                        from the full-stack development class there. </br><strong>Duties as a Teaching Assistant</strong> included one-on-one tutoring of students in JavaScript, helping students identify and debug problems in their code, occasional addition/extrapolation of lecture topics during class, maintain the daily calendar of curricula during a major shift in teaching philosophy to create a record of lessons taught which will be used as a template for future full-stack classes at BCW.</p>
                        <p>During my time as a student at Boise Code Works, I learned a variety of languages and
                        platforms including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular. We were also introduced to Node, .NET and
                        C#. <br> My “capstone project” for this class was the conception, development and design of a product
                        I named “Musical-Keymaster.” My team of two other students and myself produced this program in just
                        over a month. The app takes in a pasted chord sheet and transposes the chord references to whatever
                        key the end user desires. There is also a private storage area for users to keep their stash of songs.
                    </p>
                    <p>Prior to that, I worked for the <strong>Divine Lotus Tea Company</strong> (aka The Shangri La Tea Room
                        & Restaurant) based in Boise. <br> While there I learned to manage my time efficiently. I also strengthened
                        my skills in how to be productive in a loosely structured, low supervision environment. <br> In order
                        to use my time there most efficiently, I built shelving and organized the herb and tea inventory which
                        optimized my (and other employees) ability to find stocked items. In conjunction with this, I created
                        an inventory checklist which was used for the reorder process when items periodically went out of
                        stock. I also built a spreadsheet to track gross income from retail tea sales and graph them quarterly.
                    </p>
                    <p>Prior to my time at Divine Lotus, I was <strong>Self-Employed</strong> at a variety of jobs including
                        but not limited to: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Massage Therapy</li>
                            <li>Light Handyman Services</li>
                            <li>Professional Musican</li>
                            <li>Typesetting/Graphic Design</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Prior to this time I attended and Graduated from the Academy of Professional Careers (now called Milan) as a Massage Therapist. After Graduation, I earned a certification from the National Certification Board of Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork.</p>
